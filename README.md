# Web Scraping for Fun and Profit

Pardon the catchy, click-baity title. But I love scraping data.

But, seriously, web scraping can be profitable, and is definitely FUN.

Thanks to the countless heroes who created tutorials and answers on StackOverflow, this is my contribution to the world of web scraping.

# Tutorials List

1. [Scrape Facebook like a Boss:](https://github.com/cy-ooi88/web-scraping-for-fun-and-profit/blob/main/scrape%20facebook.ipynb)
Slightly more advanced usage of ```Selenium``` and ```BeautifulSoup``` than your average web scraping tutorial.

# Sharing is Caring

If you like the tutorial(s), please do share it with a friend! It also keeps me motivated to produce more tutorials. 😁😁

Thank you!
